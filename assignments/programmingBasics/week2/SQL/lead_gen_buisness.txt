-- 1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

select date_format(billing.charged_datetime, '%M') as month, sum(billing.amount) as revenue
from billing
where year(billing.charged_datetime)=2012 and month(billing.charged_datetime)=3
group by month;

-- 2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

select billing.client_id, sum(billing.amount) as revenue
from billing
where billing.client_id=2
group by billing.client_id;

-- 3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client with an id of 10 owns?

select sites.domain_name as website, sites.client_id from sites
where client_id=10;

-- 4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client with an id of 20?

select sites.client_id, 
count(sites.created_datetime) as number_of_websites, 
date_format(sites.created_datetime, '%M') as month_created, 
year(sites.created_datetime) 
from sites
where client_id=1
group by sites.created_datetime;

select sites.client_id, 
count(sites.created_datetime) as number_of_websites, 
date_format(sites.created_datetime, '%M') as month_created, 
year(sites.created_datetime) 
from sites
where client_id=20
group by sites.created_datetime;

-- 5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

select sites.domain_name, count(leads.site_id) as number_of_leads
from sites
join leads on sites.site_id=leads.site_id
where date(leads.registered_datetime) >= '2011-01-01' and date(leads.registered_datetime) <= '2011-02-15'
group by sites.site_id;

-- 6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

select concat(clients.first_name, ' ' ,clients.last_name) as client,
count(leads.site_id) as number_of_leads 
from clients
join sites on clients.client_id=sites.client_id
join leads on sites.site_id=leads.site_id
where date(leads.registered_datetime) >= '2011-01-01' and date(leads.registered_datetime) <= '2011-12-31'
group by sites.client_id;

-- 7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

select CONCAT(clients.first_name , ' ' , clients.last_name) as client, 
count(leads.site_id) as number_of_leads, 
date_format(registered_datetime,'%M') as month_generated
from clients
left join sites on sites.client_id = clients.client_id
left join leads on leads.site_id = sites.site_id
where year(registered_datetime) = 2011 AND month(registered_datetime) >= 1 AND month(registered_datetime) <= 6
group by CONCAT(clients.first_name , ' ' , clients.last_name), month(leads.registered_datetime);

-- 8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.



-- 9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.  First try this with integer month, second with month name.  A SELECT subquery will be needed for the second challenge.  Look at this for a hint.



-- 10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that all of the sites for each client are displayed in a single field. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
